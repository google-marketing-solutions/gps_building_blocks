# Statistical Inference

**Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product.**

We want to provide an end-to-end comprehensive pipeline to facilitate and
consolidate statistical inference analysis using
[fixed effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model)
among projects
within gPS Data Science. Statistical inference is often a very difficult task
that always requires human intervention at every single step. The aim is to
provide as much help as possible among these steps to the analyst, providing
some state-of-art feedback and raise flags when potential issues are identified.

This model also uses
[Variance Inflation Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor)
to deal with
[Multicollinearity](shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity).
